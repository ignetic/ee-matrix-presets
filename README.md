Matrix Presets
=================

For ExpressionEngine

Adds the ability to save and load matrix values within P&amp;T Matrix. Useful for duplicating or pre-populating Matrix content.


This enables you to save existing content within a Matrix which can later be loaded into another of the same field.

Simply click the Save button and give it a name to create a new preset. 
You can also overwrite existing presets or delete them.

This can also be used to speed up content population for testing purposes while in development.

Supports basic fields, including P&amp;T Fieldpack fields.
